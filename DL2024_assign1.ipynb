    "## Outline (10 points)\n",
    "#### Submission:\n",
    "We will give 2 weeks for each assignment and more for the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grades will be released after the deadline. Please also put your name and student number (if you have one) in the file name of the returned assignments. (DL2024_assign1_NAME_SURNAME_STUDENTNUMBER.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this assignment, you will learn:\n",
    "* How to load data and create a train/test split\n",
    "* How to build your own Pytorch model for simple linear regression problem on the generated data.\n",
    "* Training the model with gradient descent algorithm in Pytorch.\n",
    "* Simple visualisation of data, loss and linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks (10 points):\n",
    "* Part 1. Load dataset and split into training and testing sets (1.5 points)\n",
    "* Part 2.1 Model (1.5 points)\n",
    "* Part 2.2 Training (7 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment\n",
    "Python 3 + Pytorch (>=1.3).<br>\n",
    "Other libraries should be installed correctly such as numpy, matplotlib, *etc*., according to the dependencies of the assignment. <br>\n",
    "If you haven’t installed Pytorch and Jupyter notebook in your computer, an alternative environment to finish the assignment is CSC notebook: [`https://noppe.2.rahtiapp.fi/`](https://noppe.2.rahtiapp.fi/) -> log in with HaKa using your university account -> Jupyter Machine Learning. \n",
    "Also, googlecolab is available through your google university account (instruction in https://www.oulu.fi/en/for-students/supporting-your-studies-and-contact-information-for-students/it-services-for-students/google-workspace-for-education). Computer room TS135 contains computers with GPUs that you can utilise as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give 2 weeks for each assignment and more for the final project. So it may happen where the new assignment is published before the deadline of the previous assignment. Please do not wait till the last minute to complete the assigments, as they can be time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database\n",
    "* Advertising dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "* To find the place where you have to insert your solution, hit Crtl + F and search for **TODO:** . You are not supposed to modify the code from other parts.\n",
    "* Be careful with the shape of the weights, gradient, .. of your tensor in your implementation. Double check and make sure the shapes fit for computation, especially matrix multiplication.\n",
    "* Use only torch functions for the model, and avoid iterations. E.g. if you put a for cycle in the model function then parallelism is gone and your model will not run efficiently on GPUs. Also once you have the data loaded as tensors, you need to use torch functions, if you convert to numpy arrays in the training loop then it will not train efficiently.\n",
    "* Check the examples from the pytorch tutorial lecture, they can help understand the assignment better."
